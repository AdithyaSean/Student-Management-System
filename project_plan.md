# Student Management System - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Core System Setup (Week 1)
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up backend with Node.js and Express
- [x] Configure MySQL database
- [x] Create Sequelize models and migrations
- [x] Set up basic API endpoints
- [x] Create Angular project structure

## Phase 2: Core Features Development (Week 2-3)
### Backend
- [ ] Implement student management endpoints
- [ ] Develop course management functionality
- [ ] Create module management system
- [ ] Implement exam result tracking
- [ ] Add report generation (Excel export)

### Frontend
- [ ] Create student registration interface
- [ ] Develop course management UI
- [ ] Build exam result entry form
- [ ] Create result inquiry interface
- [ ] Implement report download functionality

## Phase 3: Validation and Security (Week 4)
- [ ] Add input validation on all forms
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Set up data validation middleware
- [ ] Implement error handling

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Week 5)
### Testing
- [ ] Unit testing for backend services
- [ ] Integration testing for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end testing for frontend
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing

### Deployment
- [ ] Create production build
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure production database
- [ ] Deploy to local environment
- [ ] Prepare deployment documentation

## Dependencies
- Node.js v16+
- MySQL 8+
- Angular 15+
- Sequelize 6+
- ExcelJS (for report generation)

## Risk Management
1. Database schema changes
   - Mitigation: Use Sequelize migrations
2. API versioning
   - Mitigation: Implement versioning from start
3. Frontend-backend integration
   - Mitigation: Use OpenAPI specification
4. Performance bottlenecks
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and pagination

## Quality Assurance
- Code reviews for all pull requests
- Automated testing coverage > 80%
- Manual testing of all user flows
- Security audit before deployment
